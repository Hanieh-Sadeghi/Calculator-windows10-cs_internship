# Windows 10 Calculator
<p>
    This is a project for the CS_Intership course, where we will implement a
    calculator with various functionalities. The goal of this project is to
    create a calculator that looks and behaves similarly to the Windows 10
    calculator while also being responsive and themeable.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Implement a Calculator Layout</h3>
<p>
    In this step, we will implement a calculator layout that resembles the
    Windows 10 calculator in maximum size (Standard mode). The calculator will
    be unresponsive but resizable, which means that it can tolerate resizing
    from desktop view to tablet view.

<h3>Step 2: Implement a Responsive Calculator</h3>
<p>
    In this step, we will make the calculator responsive just like the Windows
    10 calculator. This means that the calculator will be able to adjust its
    layout based on the screen size of the device.

  </div>

<h4>Step 3: Make the Calculator Functional</h4>
<p>
    In this step, we will add the ability to theme the calculator. We will add a
    green and blue theme, as well as a dark mode theme. Additionally, we will
    enhance the standard calculator by adding calculation functionalities using
    JavaScript.

</div>

<h4>A: Themeable Calculator</h4>
<p>
    In this substep, we will make the calculator themeable by adding a green and
    blue theme and a dark mode theme.
</p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/Picture/Step 4/black.png" width="100" height="150" >

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    In conclusion, this project is an excellent opportunity to develop practical
    skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as
    SCSS/SASS. By following the four steps outlined in this README, we will
    create a functional calculator that resembles the Windows 10 calculator in
    appearance and functionality. Through this project, we will learn how to
    create a responsive and themeable calculator and enhance its functionality
    using JavaScript. Overall, this project will help us gain valuable
    experience in web development and provide a foundation for more advanced web
    development projects.
